## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flickity (https://flickity.metafizzy.co/), GIT, Bash.

## Personal Learnings

This project was my first time building an e-commerce web page whilst following a design. I leant to create the web page mobile first, and later worked on the tablet and desktop versions. This was also my first time using JavaScript to implement certain functions on a web page. I found the flexbox grid of the shop categories particularly challenging, but I managed to overcome it and learnt a lot of HTML and CSS through this project. 

## Installation Instructions

To run Aloha, download this project and then run on a local server of your choice (Mozilla Firefox is recommended for best results).
